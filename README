This is a very simple and yet buggy project.
it used nodejs and starts tail -f on p2pool's log.

all relevant lines are converted to json and long polled to the website delievered. the index.html is delievered through nodejs also.

TODO:
 - configurable pathes
 - error handling
 - copy of forrestv nice p2pool image generator with pure html
